# Quack-a-Moo

## What is it
So you wanna be the next Shakespeare, and only want to write one horrible paragraph of a story? Then this is the place for you.
Our website facilitates the creation of a nonsensical story by collaborating with other people. We believe that collaboration will lead to elaboration. You can create your own low-effort story and wait as no one adds to it. The other option is to look at the last edit in a story and continue the story or ruin it for everyone by writing nonsense following the edit.

## What do you need to run
On your terminal run the following commands
Make sure you have __python3__ installed
```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Zer0-M/Quack-a-Moo.git # this clones our repo in order to run 
    $ python3 -m venv quack # this creates a virtual environment named quack. Replace the name as you see fit 
    $ . quack/bin/activate # this activates the virtual environment 
    $ pip3 install wheel 
    $ pip3 install flask # since our code was written using the flask framework
```

## How do you run
Run these commands in your terminal
```bash
    $ python3 app.py
```
Then go to preferred non-Chrome web browser and go to <br/>
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ <br/>
After you're done remember to disable your virtuatl environment by using the following command in the terminal: 
```bash
    $ deactivate
```
